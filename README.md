# Legacy API Server for "PHP Revival" browser extension

> This repository is not used for new version of [PHP Revival](https://github.com/php-revival/php-revival) since it uses a different approach. Instead of fetching images and icons from the external server, it uses the local images and icons. Although, this repository is still used for the old version of PHP Revival which didn't get updated to the new version.
